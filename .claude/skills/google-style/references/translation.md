# Write for a global audience

_Source: https://developers.google.com/style/translation_

We write our developer documentation in US English, but some of it is translated into languages other than English or is read by developers for whom English is not their primary language.

Write with localization, translation, and internationalization in mind. The following list defines these terms:

- *Localization:* Adapting a product and its associated documentation for a specific country. This process involves more than translation—for example, using local currencies or units of measurement.
- *Translation:* Translating one language to another language. This process might involve localization, but the two terms aren't synonymous with one another.
- *Internationalization:* Designing a product and its associated documentation to minimize the localization effort—for example, placing all UI strings in a separate file to simplify translation.

For more information, see [Language localization](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_localisation).

- [Voice and tone](tone.md)

## Use clear, concise, and unambiguous language

Consider global audiences and translation and write in a way that's clear, concise, and unambiguous.

### Use simpler words and shorter sentences

- Use a simple word. For example, don't use words like *commence* when you mean *start* or *begin*. Don't use *consequently* when you mean *so*. Don't use words like *utilize* or *leverage* when you mean *use*. (It's fine to use these words when you're conveying a special sense—for example, *Cloud Spanner utilizes up to 100% of the available CPU resources.*)

- Use a single word when it conveys the same idea as a phrase. For example, don't use a phrase like *a number of* when you can use *some* or *many*.

- Write shorter sentences. The shorter the sentence, the easier it is to translate. English sentences can be shorter in length than some languages, so an English sentence of average length might result in a long sentence when translated. Longer sentences can impair understanding, cause rendering issues on the page or product interface, lengthen translation time, and increase translation and review costs.

### Avoid phrasal verbs

- Avoid phrasal verbs when possible. A phrasal verb combines multiple words to form a single verb phrase. These verbs are also known as compound verbs. Try to substitute a simpler verb first. There might not be a better verb; for example, a few exceptions to this rule include *set up*, *log in*, and *sign in*.

  : This document uses the following terms:

  : This document makes use of the following terms:

### Use modifiers appropriately

- Don't use too many modifiers. In particular, don't use more than two nouns as modifiers of another noun.

  : A cloud-native DevSecOps pipeline in a hybrid environment

  : A hybrid cloud-native DevSecOps pipeline

- Don't misplace modifiers. For example, place a word like *only* immediately before the word or phrase that it relates to. If the meaning is still ambiguous, try rephrasing the sentence.

  : Request only one token.

  : Request no more than one token.

  : Only request one token.

### Use active voice and present tense

- Use [present tense](tense.md) and avoid complex or uncommon verb forms.
- Use active voice. The subject of the sentence is the person or thing performing the action. With passive voice, it's often hard for readers to figure out who's supposed to do something. For more information, see [Active voice](voice.md).

### Use words in their primary sense

- Don't use the same word to mean different things. In particular, avoid using the same word as both a noun and a verb in close proximity. For examples of words that have multiple meanings, see the word list entries for [once](word-list.md#once), [while](word-list.md#while), [as](word-list.md#as), and [since](word-list.md#since).
- Avoid directional language (for example, *above* or *below*) in procedural documentation. For more information, see [UI elements and interaction](ui-elements.md#buttons).

### Use helper words and optional words

- Use qualifying nouns for technical keywords. For example, when referring to a file called `example.yaml`, call it the *`example.yaml` file* and not *`example.yaml`* by itself. For more information, see [Grammatical treatment of code elements](code-in-text.md#keywords).

- Repeat a word if the redundancy improves comprehension.

  |  |  |
  |----|----|
  | If the VM has started and if you're able to connect... | If the VM has started and you're able to connect... |
  | The resource hierarchy design creates both IAM segmentation and network segmentation by default. | The resource hierarchy design creates both IAM and network segmentation by default. |
  | An egress rule whose action is `allow`, whose destination is `0.0.0.0/0`, and whose priority is the lowest possible (`65535`). | An egress rule whose action is `allow`, destination is `0.0.0.0/0`, and priority is the lowest possible (`65535`). |

- Use helper words. Helper words such as *then*, *that*, and *of* are frequently left out of conversational English. Use these words to avoid ambiguity.

  |  |  |
  |----|----|
  | If the attribute key is not found, then the default value is returned. | If the attribute key is not found, the default value is returned. |

  | Identify all of the datasets. | Identify all the datasets. |
  | Start the profiler, and then run the app. | Start the profiler, then run the app. |

- Don't omit relative pronouns. To provide clarity and to avoid ambiguity, use relative pronouns such as *that* and *which*. For more information, see [Relative pronouns](pronouns.md#relative-pronouns).

  : You can programmatically update the rules that you previously defined.

  : You can programmatically update the rules you previously defined.

### Clarify abbreviations and pronouns

- Define abbreviations. Abbreviations can be confusing out of context, and they don't translate well. Spell things out whenever possible, at least the first time that you use a given term. For more information, see [Abbreviations](abbreviations.md).

- Clarify antecedents. Using pronouns can get tricky when translators are working with small, unconnected strings of text. Help them out by making things as clear as possible. For example, if a pronoun is ambiguous, then replace it with the appropriate noun.

  : If you use the term *green beer* in an ad, then make sure that the ad is targeted.

  : If you use the term *green beer* in an ad, then make sure that it's targeted.

### Use apostrophes appropriately

Be careful with how you use plural and possessive forms. In general, don't form a plural with *'s*, don't use the plural or possessive form with trademarks of company, product, and feature names, and don't use uncommon contractions. For more information, see [Possessives](possessives.md), [Pluralization](pluralization.md), and [Contractions](contractions.md).

## Address users and their needs directly

Address the user and their needs directly and avoid providing unnecessary information.

- Address the reader directly. Use *you*, instead of *the user* or *they*, unless you're referring to someone who uses the software that the reader is developing. For more information, see [Second person and first person](person.md).

- Provide context. Don't assume that the reader already knows what you're talking about.

- Avoid negative constructions when possible. Consider whether it's necessary to tell the reader what they can't do instead of what they can.

## Be consistent

Use standard sentence structures, consistent terminology, and appropriate punctuation to avoid creating barriers to understanding, ambiguity, and mistranslations.

### Use consistent terminology

If you use a particular term for a concept in one place, then use that exact same term elsewhere, including the same capitalization. If you use different names for the same thing, translators might think you're referring to different concepts, and thus might use different translations. Inconsistency in terminology and phrasing can increase translation costs, particularly when translation memory and machine translations are used as first steps in translation.

### Use standard sentence structures and formatting

- Use standardized phrases for frequently used sentences, introductory phrases, and other common tasks. For examples, read about [introducing links](cross-references.md#link-introductions), [introducing output](placeholders.md#placeholders-in-output), and [introducing code samples](code-samples.md#introductions).

- Use standard English word order. Sentences follow the *subject + verb + object* order.

- Try to keep the main subject and verb as close to the beginning of the sentence as possible.

- Use the conditional clause first. If you want to tell the audience to do something in a particular circumstance, mention the circumstance before you provide the instruction. For more information, see [Sentence structure](sentence-structure.md).

- Make list items consistent. Make list items parallel in structure. Be consistent in your capitalization and punctuation. For more information, see [Lists](lists.md).

### Use consistent text formatting

- Use consistent typographic formats. Use bold and italics consistently. Don't switch from using italics for emphasis to underlining. For more information, see [Text-formatting summary](text-formatting.md).
- Use consistent capitalization. For more information, see [Capitalization](capitalization.md).

## Be inclusive

You're not writing for your culture. Write with inclusivity in mind. For more information, see [Writing inclusive documentation](inclusive-documentation.md).

- Write [dates and times](dates-times.md) in unambiguous and clear ways.
- Don't be too culturally specific. In particular, don't refer to specific holidays, cultural practices, or sports unless you're certain they're known worldwide.
- Use a diverse set of example names. If you need to use people's names (for example, as email addresses), use a diverse set of names. For more information, see [Example domains and names](examples.md).
- Avoid colloquialisms, idioms, or slang. Phrases like *ballpark figure*, *back burner*, or *hang in there* can be confusing and difficult to translate.
- Avoid humor. Most humor is difficult to translate, and much humor is culturally specific.
- Avoid geographically specific references, like the seasons. Remember that August isn't summer in the southern hemisphere. For more information, see [Expressing divisions of the year](dates-times.md#divisions-year).

## Consider accessibility for images

Use screenshots and text in figures sparingly. Images don't get translated. Any new information should be conveyed through text and not introduced in a figure or image. For more information, see [Figures and other images](images.md).
