# Phase 65: Apple Business L1/L2 + Hub Navigation Integration — Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** L1 staff can use a single shared iPad passcode reset runbook (L1 #34) that cross-links to the admin-directory lookup + canonical admin-context doc; L2 engineering can use a 7-leaf permission-denied decision tree (L2 #26); cross-platform symptom routing + quick-ref cards + operations index + docs/index.md hub all gain Apple Business sections — all edits to existing hub files are APPEND-ONLY with the navigation-files-last invariant honored per v1.5 Phase 57+59 precedent.
**Verified:** 2026-05-22T22:00:00Z
**Status:** PASSED
**Re-verification:** Yes — independent verifier audit layered on Wave-5 executor close-gate doc

## Independent Verifier Findings (Goal-Backward Audit)

**Verifier:** Claude (gsd-verifier), adversarial stance — SUMMARY.md claims not trusted.

All validator commands were re-run live in the author environment. All key deliverable files were read directly and cross-referenced against SC#1-5 requirements. Findings below are based solely on codebase evidence.

### Observable Truths — Independent Verification

| # | Truth (from SC) | Status | Codebase Evidence |
|---|-----------------|--------|-------------------|
| 1 | L1 #34 exists with `platform: ios+macos+shared-ipad`, `#which-admin-owns-this-pool` link, 3-path matrix with OP-11 gating on Path C, cross-link to `12-shared-ipad-passcode-reset.md`, L1 #00-index appended | VERIFIED | File read directly; all elements confirmed at correct lines; `grep` confirmed 3 occurrences of `#which-admin-owns-this-pool` + 6 occurrences of OP-11 references + `12-shared-ipad-passcode-reset` present at lines 42, 52, 91, 109, 139 |
| 2 | L2 #26 exists with 7-leaf Mermaid tree (DA-9 LOCKED) — 7 distinct leaf types confirmed; L2 #00-index appended | VERIFIED | File read directly; `([` count = 8 (7 leaf nodes + 1 root); all 7 leaf types (role-lacks-permission / OU-boundary / Apple-Business-scope / Intune-scope / federation-state / quota-limit / Account-Holder-lockout) present in Mermaid block; L2 00-index confirmed at line 195 |
| 3 | 5 hub appends delivered: `## Apple Business Governance Failure Scenarios` in common-issues.md; `## Apple Business Quick Reference` in quick-ref-l1.md and quick-ref-l2.md; `## Apple Business Governance` in operations/00-index.md; Apple Business sub-H3 + banner + cross-platform refs in docs/index.md | VERIFIED | All 5 files confirmed; tail output shows sections appended correctly; PITFALL-6 invariant verified — all pre-existing H2 slugs present post-edit (grep -n "^## " output matches pre-edit inventory) |
| 4 | C16 4-edge cross-link triangle PASSES: l1_34→admin_12, admin_12→l1_34, common_issues→quick_ref_l1, quick_ref_l1→l1_34 — zero exemptions | VERIFIED | Atomic commit `8721a63` verified via `git log --stat` (4 files, correct shape); `c16_missing_endpoint_exemptions: []` confirmed in allowlist; `v1.6-milestone-audit.mjs` C16 PASS confirmed via live run |
| 5 | Zero existing hub-file anchors shift across all 6 inventoried files — PITFALL-6 / SC#5 anti-regression honored; navigation-files-last invariant honored | VERIFIED | `grep -n "^## "` on common-issues.md (7 H2s, new one at line 337 after pre-existing), quick-ref-l1.md (11 H2s, new one at line 216), operations/00-index.md (6 H2s, new one at line 62); back-link in 12- confirmed at line 195; anchor slugs unchanged |
| 6 | Validator chain: `check-phase-65.mjs` 28 PASS / 0 FAIL / 5 SKIP; `check-phase-64.mjs` 24 PASS / 0 FAIL / 5 SKIP; `check-phase-62.mjs` 29 PASS / 0 FAIL / 5 SKIP; `v1.6-milestone-audit.mjs` 15 PASS / 0 FAIL / 0 SKIP | VERIFIED | All 4 validators re-run live; exit codes all 0; output captured verbatim in Section B below |
| 7 | REQUIREMENTS.md ABNAV-01..07 all marked `[x] Complete` in both checkbox list and traceability table | VERIFIED | `grep ABNAV .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` output shows all 7 checked `[x]` and `Complete` in traceability table |

### Anti-Patterns Found

None. Zero debt markers (`TBD`, `FIXME`, `XXX`) found in any Phase 65 modified file. The `[CITED: training; needs live verification]` annotations are intentional review-by markers with a specific `review_by: 2026-07-21` date in frontmatter — these are documented open items, not orphaned debt.

### Behavioral Spot-Checks

| Behavior | Command | Result | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| check-phase-65.mjs exits 0 | `node scripts/validation/check-phase-65.mjs` | 28 PASS, 0 FAIL, 5 SKIP | PASS |

| v1.6-milestone-audit.mjs exits 0 with C16 PASS | `node scripts/validation/v1.6-milestone-audit.mjs` | 15 PASS, 0 FAIL, 0 SKIP (C16 PASS) | PASS |
| Atomic commit 8721a63 covers 4 correct files | `git log -1 --stat 8721a63` | 4 files changed: 12-, allowlist, check-64, check-62 | PASS |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan | Description | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|------------|-------------|--------|---------|
| ABNAV-01 | 65-02-PLAN.md | L1 #34 with pool-owner lookup + 3-path matrix + OP-11 gating + compound frontmatter + L1 00-index | SATISFIED | File verified; REQUIREMENTS.md shows `[x] Complete` |
| ABNAV-02 | 65-02-PLAN.md | L2 #26 with 7-leaf Mermaid + L2 00-index | SATISFIED | File verified; REQUIREMENTS.md shows `[x] Complete` |
| ABNAV-03 | 65-03-PLAN.md | `## Apple Business Governance Failure Scenarios` in common-issues.md | SATISFIED | grep confirms at line 337 |

| ABNAV-07 | 65-03-PLAN.md | Apple Business sub-H3 + banner + cross-platform refs in docs/index.md | SATISFIED | grep confirms `### Apple Business Governance` at line 277 |

**All 7 ABNAV requirements: SATISFIED. No orphaned requirements.**

### Human Verification Required

None. All SC#1-5 requirements are verifiable programmatically. The single residual open item (live Apple Business portal navigation step verification for L1 #34 Path A) is tagged `[CITED: training; needs live verification]` with `review_by: 2026-07-21` in the runbook frontmatter — this is a 60-day review-window item per the standard corpus pattern, not a phase-blocking gap.

### Gaps Summary

No gaps. All 7 must-haves verified. All 5 validators exit 0. All 7 ABNAV requirements satisfied. Zero debt markers. Zero anchor regressions. C16 4-edge triangle live with 0 exemptions.

---

## Section A — Executive Summary (Wave-5 Executor Record, Preserved)

Phase 65 delivered all 7 ABNAV-01..07 requirements across 5 waves: L1 #34 and L2 #26 runbooks (Wave 2), 5 hub-file appends (Wave 3), and the C16 4-edge cross-link integrity triangle (Wave 4 atomic commit `8721a63`). The C16 4-edge triangle is fully live with 0 exemptions remaining in `v1.6-audit-allowlist.json`. The PITFALL-6 anti-regression invariant is honored across all 6 inventoried files — zero pre-existing H2/H3 anchor slugs shifted. All 3 validators (`v1.6-milestone-audit.mjs`, `check-phase-64.mjs`, `check-phase-65.mjs`) plus the full chain (`check-phase-62.mjs` and `check-phase-63.mjs`) exit 0, confirming Phase 66 may now spawn the terminal re-audit from a FRESH WORKTREE per D-22 auditor-independence.

## Section B — Commands Run + Exit Codes

| Command | Exit Code | Summary Line |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| `node scripts/validation/v1.6-milestone-audit.mjs` | 0 | `Summary: 15 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped` |
| `node scripts/validation/check-phase-62.mjs` | 0 | `Result: 29 PASS, 0 FAIL, 5 SKIPPED` |
| `node scripts/validation/check-phase-63.mjs` | 0 | `Result: 27 PASS, 0 FAIL, 5 SKIPPED` |
| `node scripts/validation/check-phase-64.mjs` | 0 | `Result: 24 PASS, 0 FAIL, 5 SKIPPED` |
| `node scripts/validation/check-phase-65.mjs` | 0 | `Result: 28 PASS, 0 FAIL, 5 SKIPPED` |

CHAIN_SKIP entries {48, 51, 58, 60, 61} are pre-existing failures unrelated to Phase 65 (CRLF + archived-path issues carried forward from check-phase-64.mjs:55-72 documentation); these are expected non-fatal and are tracked for Phase 66 fresh-worktree resolution.

## Section F — C16 4-Edge Triangle Live Status

All 4 edges verified via real file content. Zero allowlist masking. `c16_missing_endpoint_exemptions` length = 0 confirmed by V-65-13 PASS and `v1.6-milestone-audit.mjs` C16 PASS.

| Edge ID | From File | To File | Load-Bearing Substring | Present? | Harness Status | Exempted? |
|---------|-----------|---------|------------------------|----------|----------------|-----------|

**0 EXEMPTED entries** — `scripts/validation/v1.6-audit-allowlist.json` `c16_missing_endpoint_exemptions`: `[]` (empty array, length 0). All 4 sunset-65 exemptions removed by Wave 4 atomic commit `8721a63`.

**C16 4-edge triangle: LIVE — 4 edges live, 0 exemptions.**

## Section G — V-64-05 Reconciliation Trace

- **(a) Pre-Wave-4 state:** `check-phase-64.mjs` lines 135-145 contained a NEGATIVE assertion — `V-64-05: 12-shared-ipad-passcode-reset.md must NOT contain 34-apple-business (C16 sunset Phase 65; must not appear in Phase 64)`. The file did not contain the back-link substring, so the NEGATIVE assertion PASSED correctly at Phase 64 close.

- **(b) Wave 4 atomic commit `8721a63`:** Files modified in one indivisible commit: `docs/cross-platform/apple-business/12-shared-ipad-passcode-reset.md` (+2 lines: new back-link bullet in `## Cross-References` tail + version history row), `scripts/validation/v1.6-audit-allowlist.json` (4 sunset-65 entries removed → empty array), `scripts/validation/check-phase-64.mjs` (V-64-05 NEGATIVE→POSITIVE flip), and `scripts/validation/check-phase-62.mjs` (V-62-SIDECAR RECONCILED: expected-4→expected-0 — see Section G deviation note below).

- **(c) Post-Wave-4 state:** `check-phase-64.mjs` V-64-05 now reads `V-64-05 [RECONCILED Phase 65]: 12-shared-ipad-passcode-reset.md MUST contain 34-apple-business (C16 back-link landed)`. The file contains `34-apple-business` (the new back-link bullet). POSITIVE assertion PASSES. Both the assertion flip and the substring arrival landed atomically — there was no intermediate state where assertion and file content were misaligned.

**V-64-05 transition:** Phase 64 close (NEGATIVE, correct) → Wave 4 atomic commit (POSITIVE [RECONCILED], correct) → Close-gate (POSITIVE, stable). `check-phase-64.mjs` exit 0 confirmed at close-gate.

**V-62-SIDECAR deviation note:** The Wave 4 plan specified 3 files; emptying the allowlist (sub-action 2) caused `check-phase-62.mjs` V-62-SIDECAR (which asserted `c16_missing_endpoint_exemptions.length === 4`) to fail, cascading CHAIN-62/63 failures into check-phase-64 and check-phase-65. Reconciliation: V-62-SIDECAR flipped from `=== 4` (expected old state) to `=== 0` (expected new state) with `[RECONCILED Phase 65]` label. Added as 4th file to the atomic commit. The indivisibility contract is preserved — all 4 changes land in commit `8721a63`.

## Section I — Routed to 60-Day Re-Verification Window (by 2026-07-21)

`last_verified: 2026-05-22` on all Phase 65 deliverables → `review_by: 2026-07-21`.

### Items Routed to 60-Day Window

The following items from `65-RESEARCH.md` Open Questions were not fully resolvable against live Apple Business portal during execution and are tagged `[CITED: training; needs live verification]` in the delivered docs:

1. **Path A portal navigation steps in L1 #34** — Steps in `## Path A — Apple Business UI (L1-executable)` reference portal paths (Settings > Devices > Select device > Reset Passcode) that are accurate as of training knowledge but require verification against a live Apple Business Manager tenant. Marked `[CITED: training; needs live verification]` in the runbook per the pattern inherited from `12-shared-ipad-passcode-reset.md`.

2. **7-leaf Mermaid tree breadth-vs-depth shape** — L2 #26 uses a flat 7-leaf tree from a single root decision node (DA-9 LOCKED). No open question remains; DA-9 shape was confirmed as the locking contract and was honored.

3. **L2 #26 Intune-scope leaf phrasing** — D-02 resolved to Option A (avoid C15 banned phrases via scope-boundary callout language); ABAUDIT-24 was NOT allocated. This is fully resolved.

**Net open items routed to window:** 1 (portal navigation step verification for L1 #34 Path A steps). All other Open Questions from `65-RESEARCH.md` were resolved during Wave 2-4 execution.

### Assumptions Log

`65-RESEARCH.md` Assumptions Log was empty at Wave 1. No new `[ASSUMED]` or `[verify in portal]` items were introduced during Waves 2-5. The single residual item above is already tagged in the runbook and routes to the standard 60-day re-verification cadence.

## Section K — Phase 66 Readiness Signal

Phase 66 may now spawn the terminal re-audit from a FRESH WORKTREE per D-22 auditor-independence. All v1.6 author-phase outputs are stable and verified: `check-phase-65.mjs` exits 0 (28 PASS, 0 FAIL, 5 SKIPPED); `v1.6-milestone-audit.mjs` exits 0 (15 PASS, 0 FAIL, 0 SKIPPED); the full chain 62→63→64→65 exits 0. The CHAIN_SKIP entries {48, 51, 58, 60, 61} are expected non-fatal pre-existing failures (CRLF + archived-path issues per check-phase-64.mjs:55-72 documentation) that Phase 66's fresh Linux worktree is expected to resolve — they do NOT indicate content-phase regressions.

`check-phase-65.mjs` ships as a Phase 65 deliverable (validator-as-deliverable pattern). Phase 66 will RUN it from the fresh worktree as part of the terminal re-audit chain (62→63→64→65→66). The VERIFICATION record you are reading is the signal Phase 66 reads BEFORE spawning — it confirms all checks PASS in the author environment, establishing the baseline that the terminal re-audit independently verifies.

## Atomic-Trio Reconciliation Record

Per D-04a + 62-08-PLAN:464-465 indivisibility contract — Wave 4 commit `8721a63` landed:
- **(a)** `12-shared-ipad-passcode-reset.md` back-link to L1 #34 in existing `## Cross-References` tail (new 4th bullet: `- **L1 runbook:** [L1 #34 — Apple Business Shared iPad Passcode Reset](...) (Path A L1-delegated entry point)`)
- **(b)** 4 sunset-65 C16 exemptions removed from `v1.6-audit-allowlist.json` `c16_missing_endpoint_exemptions` → empty array `[]` (length 0)
- **(c)** `check-phase-64.mjs` V-64-05 NEGATIVE→POSITIVE flip [RECONCILED Phase 65]
- **(d) DEVIATION CAPTURED:** `check-phase-62.mjs` V-62-SIDECAR length === 4 → length === 0 [RECONCILED Phase 65] (cross-validator dependency surfaced during executor pre-commit gate; reconciled within the same atomic commit per the indivisibility contract — 4th file added to the atomic commit; 3-file specification in 65-04-PLAN was written before the cascading CHAIN-62/CHAIN-63 failure was discovered)

All validators exit 0 post-commit. The atomic commit covers 4 files (not 3 as planned) with zero intermediate broken state.
